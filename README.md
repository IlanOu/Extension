# Introduction

This project follows on from [Alban Crepel](https://github.com/AlbanCrepel)'s course.

The aim of this project was to test different technologies that I was unfamiliar with (in this case, Nuxt and Tailwind).
I created a new Wikipedia design (because right now it's pretty lame).

# Project Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.
Look at this too : [Nuxt + Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org) and [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

Install Tailwind:

```bash
#npm
npm install -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss

#pnpm
pnpm i -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss

#yarn
yarn add -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm run dev

# yarn
yarn dev

# bun
bun run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm run build

# yarn
yarn build

# bun
bun run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm run preview

# yarn
yarn preview

# bun
bun run preview
```
